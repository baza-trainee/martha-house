      "The situation in Ukraine is dire. On February 24th, the Russian army launched a full-scale military offensive against our country. Dozens of Ukrainian cities and towns are being bombed and shelled from all types of weapons. Missiles hit children's hospitals, kindergartens, schools, and residential buildings. Civilians are hiding in basements, metro stations, and bomb shelters. Our Foundation cannot and will not stand by.",
      "Currently, we are accommodating women with children and the elderly from all over the country in our center. We accept families with household pets and with no restrictions, we settle them, feed them, provide medical care, and try to make this time a little less traumatic for the little ones. We have also taken in three evacuated children's homes from the South of Ukraine. These are children from birth to 7 years old. Therefore, we URGENTLY need your help and support!",
      "We are urgently finishing the construction of the fourth and fifth buildings with bomb shelters right now! This will allow us to accommodate an additional two hundred evacuated children who have been affected by the war. For this, we need funds and construction materials. We also have a constant need for food, medicine, hygiene items, pillows, baby food, and clothing.",
      "In addition, the Foundation is trying to support children's hospitals and impoverished families throughout the country. Thousands of children with complex diagnoses have been left on their own amidst the war. Hospitals urgently need essentials – clean water, food, medical supplies, and consumables."

        "The shelter for mothers and their children emerged out of an urgent need. An increasing number of women were reaching out to the foundation, seeking shelter and rescue for themselves and their children. Initially, it operated in a rented building. Over a few years of its operation there, the 'City of Goodness' assisted nearly 600 children. However, by 2018, it became clear that the 'City of Goodness' required its own building. Firstly, no rented house could accommodate all those who sought help from across Ukraine. Secondly, the houses weren't designed to house a large number of children of various ages simultaneously, nor did they take into consideration the principles of inclusivity required for mothers and children in different physical states and health conditions. This is when our major construction project began."

The 'City of Goodness' will not be state-funded; it exists solely due to the caring individuals who are concerned about the lives of underprivileged children. Throughout the construction, ordinary people, business representatives, and non-profit organizations supported our idea with their contributions – whether physical, material, creative, informational, or emotional."

Most of them come to the center with only the clothes they are wearing. So, we call upon every kind-hearted individual – support the 'City of Goodness'! Help us transform it into a realm of absolute love, acceptance, and assistance for those who've lost faith in human kindness. Even your smallest contribution becomes a building block of someone's happy childhood."
