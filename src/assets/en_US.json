      "The situation in Ukraine is dire. On February 24th, the Russian army launched a full-scale military offensive against our country. Dozens of Ukrainian cities and towns are being bombed and shelled from all types of weapons. Missiles hit children's hospitals, kindergartens, schools, and residential buildings. Civilians are hiding in basements, metro stations, and bomb shelters. Our Foundation cannot and will not stand by.",
      "Currently, we are accommodating women with children and the elderly from all over the country in our center. We accept families with household pets and with no restrictions, we settle them, feed them, provide medical care, and try to make this time a little less traumatic for the little ones. We have also taken in three evacuated children's homes from the South of Ukraine. These are children from birth to 7 years old. Therefore, we URGENTLY need your help and support!",
      "We are urgently finishing the construction of the fourth and fifth buildings with bomb shelters right now! This will allow us to accommodate an additional two hundred evacuated children who have been affected by the war. For this, we need funds and construction materials. We also have a constant need for food, medicine, hygiene items, pillows, baby food, and clothing.",
      "In addition, the Foundation is trying to support children's hospitals and impoverished families throughout the country. Thousands of children with complex diagnoses have been left on their own amidst the war. Hospitals urgently need essentials â€“ clean water, food, medical supplies, and consumables."
